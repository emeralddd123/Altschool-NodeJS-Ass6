# Express Authentication and Authorization Using JWT

Welcome to the <repository-name> repository! This repository demonstrates how to implement user authentication and authorization in an Express.js application using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). We have two branches for different implementations:

1. **Mongoose Implementation**: The `mongoose-branch` showcases how to integrate authentication and authorization with Mongoose, a popular MongoDB ODM. If you prefer MongoDB and Mongoose, head over to the [Mongoose Branch](https://github.com/<repository-name>/<mongoose-branch>).

2. **Sequelize Implementation**: The `sequelize-branch` demonstrates how to implement authentication and authorization with Sequelize, a widely used SQL-based ORM. If you prefer SQL databases and Sequelize, visit the [Sequelize Branch](https://github.com/<repository-name>/<sequelize-branch>).

## Features

- User registration and login.
- JWT-based authentication.
- Role-based authorization.
- Secure endpoints and routes.
